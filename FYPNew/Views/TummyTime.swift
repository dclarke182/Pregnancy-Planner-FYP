It also may be a good idea to practise tummy time once your baby is changed and fed. \n \nThe more your baby gets used to it the easier and longer they will be able to practise tummy time. \n \nA great thing to help stimulate your baby is to place a toy or something to capture your babyâ€™s attention, in which captures their attention.").font(.system(size: 16)).padding(.bottom)
